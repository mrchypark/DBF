Description: Functions of the dplyr package has the ability 
            to convert database-specific functions directly into sql 
            when the database is the source. 
            However, you can only use the web to search its features. 
            If you register function names in RDB as dummy functions in R, 
            it will be easier to use. DBF is an abbreviation for DataBase Function, 
            which provides convenience when using database-specific functions in tidyverse syntax.
